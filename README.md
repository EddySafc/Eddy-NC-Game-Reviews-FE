This is the repo for the frontend of my recent project in which I have created a Game Review site. You will find many useful features such as being able to **upvote comments**, **post new comments**, **vote** on articles which you agree/disagree with and many more.

## Introduction

### Technology used:

- React v18.2.0
- React-router-dome v6.4.4
- axios v1.2.0
- create-react-app
- Node v19.0.0

### Backend

This project uses a custom backend created by me here: (https://github.com/EddySafc/Eddy-NC-Game-Reviews-BE)

All information on that is within the repo linked but as an overview the technology used is as follows:

- Express.JS
- NodeJS
- PostgreSQL

## Set-up for self-hosting.

To host this app yourself you can do so by following these instructions:

- Click the green Code button at the top of the repo.

- Copy the link that shows.

- Open the terminal where ever you would like to store the files and type the following.

```
git clone (then paste)
```

- Once that has completed you must install the dependencies by typing.

```
npm install
```

- This should install everything you need for to run it yourself which you can do by going back to the console and typing this script.

```
npm start
```

# Requirements

- NodeJS - v19.0.0
